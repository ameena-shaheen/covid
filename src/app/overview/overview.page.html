    <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.<br>

      Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.<br>  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.<br>
      
      The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads.<br> Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. <br>
      
      The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).<br>
      
      At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19.</p>
